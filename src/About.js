      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>As a passionate learner and aspiring web developer, I am a recent graduate of U of M's full-stack web boot camp, pursuing my dream career. With almost ten years of experience in the food service industry, I was looking for a change that would require more flexible hours and a different set of problem-solving skills. Since discovering coding through friends in this field, I have developed a passion for web development. I am excited to continue developing my skills and exploring the ever-evolving world of web development.</p>
